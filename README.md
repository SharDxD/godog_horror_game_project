# godog_horror_game_project

General description:
- The game will consist of several levels. Levels would be precreated (not
randomly generated) to be able to create a simple storytelling. Each level
should ideally be a chain of connected premises (something close to
indoor actions of Outlast 1). Some of the rooms will have a source of light,
some not. Doors are optional, too, and can be opened.
- Higher the level - more enemies will be spawned. Enemies will have a
simple detection/chase logic. If they see you, they will go after you. After
they collide with the protagonist the game is finished, that means you shell
avoid them.
- Protagonist will be a human-like figure with the ability to hold some objects
(possible lanterns of night vision cameras). He will be able to jump, run,
shift and bend. The interaction with the world, say doors, is also possible.
- Textures will be stone-like mimicking the insides of an old abandoned
building. The torch or lantern will be the main lighting source, but in some
rooms there will be some dim bulbs or curtained windows.

Some of the aspects of the game can be changed during development as well
as the set of features. For now I am doing research on internal image filters
inside Godot to be able to mimic old infrared cameras, which will be usable by
the player.
All of the in game mechanics will be presented in some sort of block
schematic (they are now in development), as well as schemes of the levels
and some rough 3d models of the objects.
